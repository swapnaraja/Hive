desc emp;
OK
id                  	int                 	                    
name                	string              	                    
dept_id             	int 

------Adding address field in between id and name
step 1 -> by default we can add only at the end
alter table emp add columns (address string);

desc emp;
OK
id                  	int                 	                    
name                	string              	                    
dept_id             	int                 	                    
address             	string


to change the position of the column 

alter table emp change column  address address string after name;
desc emp;
OK
id                  	int                 	                    
name                	string
address             	string
dept_id             	int
can not delete single column so workaround is give the list of fields to keep
alter table emp replace columns (id int,name string,address string)
